# MiniProject-GameInC
This is my course mini project for Computer Architecture and Organization where in I have made a simple game in C to be run on DE1-SoC with Nios II Processor

The ideation started with making a basic game to be made on the Nios II processor but with a Twist . So , this is a tic tac toe game but with an added layer of gambline / betting .
The players will play three rounds of Tic-Tac-Toe with a bet or a blind (A more riskier bet) . 

The Algorithms used are :
1) Bresman's algorithm to draw a line
2) Bresman's algorithm to draw a Thick Line
3) Bresman's algorithm to draw a circle
